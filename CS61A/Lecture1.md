  * Course Staff



Call Expression: 调用表达---operator,operand(运算对象)

Nested Expression: 嵌套表达



## Lecture 2

'Ctrl+l': clean lines in python interpreter



**name:** using assign method

**assign:** "=", can also be used to functions---two names mean same function



* Expressions:
  * Primitive expressions
  * Call expressions

* Environment Diagrams: visualize the interpreter's process, keep track on the names and values.
* Defining Function:
  * Assignment is a simple means of abstraction: binds names to values
  * Function definition is a more powerful means of abstraction: binds name to expression

* Function: 
  * signature: indicates how many arguments a function take
  * body: defines the computational process expressed by a function

* Procedure for calling/applying user-defined functions:

  1. Adding a local frame, forming a *new* environment

  2. Bind the function's *formal parameter(形参)* to its *arguments(实参)* in that frame

  3. Execute the body of the function in that new environment



An environment is a sequence of frames, in the frames are names and expressions.
