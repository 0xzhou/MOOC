# 17. Representation Learning and Generative Learning Using Autoencoders and GANs

### Efficient Data Representation

### Stacked Autoencoders

#### Tying Weights

In training of an autoencoder, it is common to *tie* the weights of decoder layers to the weights of encoder layers. This halves the number of weights in the model, speeding up training and limiting the risk of overfitting.

### Sparse Autoencoders

### 	Variational Autoencoders
